## What is it?

nexOS is a new bot that always gets defeated by other discord bots.

It is simple, fast, and underrated.

## Features

- Reddit-Integrated Commands
- HTTPS Commands
- Boring Commands
- Useless commands
- Literally nothing (yet!)

## Backwards Compatibility 

!> **v17 and v18 Release Modules (from any milestone,) may not be compatible with the v19 m3 update.**
 This is due to significant changes made to the Module scanDir and depMag, most modules will continue functioning.
 Modules requiring scanDir or uses a system to find other commands may not work other than in their container. 
 Example: A module can reach for another module's info in the **same directory.** If the module attempts to locate a command outside the directory (going up in the directory list) then the Module will fail to locate the other Module and will actiavte anti-shutdown safeguards.

?> Please remember to read the developer documentation for any questions.


## Release Versions
Versions are released typically every month. 
!> **NOTICE** nexOS21 will be the final Release Version of nexOS. **This has not been finalized and changes may arise in the future.** nexOS will continue to be updated via Build Versions rather then Release Versions.

## Build Version
The System Version does not influence the release version.
It is simply to distinguish significant updates (along with the evolution) and makes it unnecessary to change the release version early.

**Latest Build**
v19 e3 **Revedend**

|---------|------------|---------------------------------------|

## Community

I typically talk in my [Discord Server.](https://discord.gg/srhxjdMdYj) 
You can test the bot there, report bugs, and see up-to-date status and announcements there too.

## Special Thanks

To several servers for allowing me to test the bot in their servers.

### Current Servers nexOS is in
[Kelly's World Community Server](https://discord.gg/5WazRCt)

uniDev Server **Check the Community Section here.**
HRD Applications Server **Private Server**
### Previous Servers
Dark Angel **Link Redacted**
High Rose Asylum **Violation of TOS**
Alex's Server **Stolen copy of nexOS**

and that's all the servers that allowed me to test the bot in it.
Either the ones that had the bot before were removed because of the lack of trust, or that they violated nexGroup Terms of Service.
