## What is it?

nexOS is a new bot that always gets defeated by other discord bots.

It is simple, fast, and underrated.

## Features

- Reddit-Integrated Commands
- HTTPS Commands
- Boring Commands
- Useless commands
- Literally nothing (yet!)

## Community

I typically talk in my [Discord Server.](https://discord.gg/srhxjdMdYj) 
You can test the bot there, report bugs, and see up-to-date status and announcements there too.

## Special Thanks

To several servers for allowing me to test the bot in their servers.

### Current Servers nexOS is in
[Kelly's World Community Server](https://discord.gg/5WazRCt)

uniDev Server **Check the Community Section here.**
HRD Applications Server **Private Server**
### Previous Servers
Dark Angel **Link Redacted**
High Rose Asylum **Violation of TOS**
Alex's Server **Stolen copy of nexOS**

and that's all the servers that allowed me to test the bot in it.
Either the ones that had the bot before were removed because of the lack of trust, or that they violated nexGroup Terms of Service.
